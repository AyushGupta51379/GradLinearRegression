# GradLinearRegression
Gradient Descent for Linear Regression (by Ayush Gupta, Credit: Matt Nedrich)

# Dataset
I'm using a small dataset of student test scores and the amount of hours they studied. Intuitively, there must be a relationship right? 
The more you study, the better your test scores should be. 

We're going to use linear regression to prove this relationship.

# Visualization of data using scatter plot
This shows the distribution of data

# Visualizing the results after applying gradient descent method of Linear Regression
Dark red line is the line of best fit.The dashed lines are at distances of 31pts and 32 pts from line of best fit (dark line).

Some Credits for this project's code go to [mattnedrich](https://github.com/mattnedrich) and [Matt's blog](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/06/24/gradient-descent-linear-regression/). I've provided end to end techniques of working on this project, like visualizing the data and visualizing the result after applying gradient descent for linear regression technique on this data, slight modifications to the original code by mattnedrich, and the results of those techniques. - GUPTA, Ayush.
