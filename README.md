# GradLinearRegression
Gradient Descent for Linear Regression

# Dataset
I'm using a small dataset of student test scores and the amount of hours they studied. Intuitively, there must be a relationship right? 
The more you study, the better your test scores should be. 

We're going to use linear regression to prove this relationship.
